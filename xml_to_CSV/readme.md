## How it works
I wanted to extract specific values from the STIG Viewer application checklist file, to use for creating reports.
Run the .py file from local directory and follow instructions on the console.
- the extension of the file DOES NOT MATTER as long as the file a properly XML formatted file.
- The input file will have the .ckl extension.
- The output file name can be anything you want - I like .txt to keep it simple

**Note:**".ckl" must follow the same tree structure as "example.ckl" in this repository

Once the program is complete, use Excel to IMPORT the newly created file. (The one you named)
- Use the (|) character as the delimiter.
