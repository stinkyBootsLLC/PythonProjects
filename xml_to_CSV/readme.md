# STIG Checklist Value Extractor

> Purpose: To extract certain attribute values from 
the [STIG VIEWER](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/srg-stig-tools/) .ckl file for creating reports.
I wanted to extract specific values from the STIG Viewer application checklist (.ckl) file, 
to use for creating reports.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine 
for development and testing purposes.  

- Download this repository to your local machine. The XML (.ckl) file must be in the same directory
as the (.py) file. 
- Run the .py file from local directory and follow instructions 
on the console. **Note:** Use (example.ckl) as a test input file.
- The extension of the file DOES NOT MATTER as long as the file is a properly XML formatted file.
- The output file name can be anything you want - I like .txt to keep it simple
- ".ckl" must follow the same tree structure as "example.ckl" in this repository
- Once the program is complete, use Excel (or any other spreadsheet program) to IMPORT the newly created file. 
(The one you named) **Note:** Use the (|) character as the delimiter.
