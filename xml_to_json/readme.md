# STIG Checklist Value Extractor

> Purpose: To extract certain tag values from 
the [STIG VIEWER](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/srg-stig-tools/) .ckl file for creating reports.
I wanted to extract specific values from the STIG Viewer application checklist (.ckl) file, 
to use for creating reports.

		"severity": "medium",
		"Status": "Open",
		"Detail": "settings not set",
		"Comment": "working on a solution"

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine 
for development and testing purposes.  

- Download this repository to your local machine. The XML (.ckl) file must be in the same directory
as the (.py) file. 
- Run the .py file from local directory and follow instructions 
on the console. **Note:** Use (example.ckl) as a test input file.
- The extension of the file DOES NOT MATTER as long as the file is a properly XML formatted file.
- The output file name can be anything you want - I like .json to keep it simple
- ".ckl" must follow the same tree structure as "example.ckl" in this repository
- Once the program is complete, use Excel (or any other spreadsheet program) to IMPORT the newly created file. 
(The one you named).

### Prerequisites

Must have Python 3.8 installed on host machine. Get [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)
