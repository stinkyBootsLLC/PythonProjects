File: compareFiles.py
Created Date: 9/12/2021
Purpose: Compare two text files for different and common lines between the two files.

- Open both files in read mode
- Store list of strings
- Start comparing both files with the help of intersection() method for common strings
- Compare both files for differences using while loop
- Output results to external file
- Close both files
